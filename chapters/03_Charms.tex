    Keywords={Balanced, Excellency, Fire},
    Mins={Athletics 1, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~168]{db}
}{effortlessly-rising-flame}

Fire fills the Dragon-Blood's body, suffusing her with power. \tldr{She may add
automatic successes to an Athletics roll for two motes each, and rolls an
additional non-Charm die for every 10.}


\Charm{Bellows-Pumping Stride}{%
    Cost=3m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Fire,
    Mins={Athletics 3, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~168]{db}
}{bellows-pumping-stride}

The Dragon-Blood darts forward with an explosive burst of speed to pursue her
foes. \tldr{She rolls an additional non-Charm die on a rush for every 1 that
appears in the rushed character's opposing roll.}

\begin{Possible}
    With Athletics 5, Essence 3, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Fire Aura when
    she reflexively moves to pursue an enemy after successfully rushing him with
    this Charm to ignite a fiery trail behind her, an environmental hazard with
    difficulty 3 and Damage~\Pool{\Val{Essence}/2}[rounded up]L/round. It burns
    until the end of the round unless the Dragon-Blood crossed over a flammable
    surface such as a wooden floor or grass, which ignites until extinguished or
    end of scene.
\end{Possible}



\CharmSection{bureaucracy-charms}{Bureaucracy Charms}

\Charm{Geese-Flying-South Administration}{
    Cost=2m per success,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Excellency, Water},
    Mins={Bureaucracy 1, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~181]{db}
}{geese-flying-south-administration}

The Essence of a bureaucracy is flow --- the flow of a leader's orders to her
subordinates, the flow of wealth in and out, the flow of information, the flow
of progress and delay. \tldr{The Dragon-Blood may add automatic successes to a
Bureaucracy roll for two motes each, and rerolls 6s until the cease to appear.}


\Charm{Confluence of Savant Thought}{%
    Cost=2m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Bureaucracy 2, Essence 1},
    Type=Simple,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~181]{db}
}{confluence-of-savant-thought}

The Dragon-Blood's understanding of bureaucracies is vast, encompassing the
myriad ways in which mercantile and administrative tasks pool and eddy like
water. \tldr{She rolls \Pool{\Val{Intelligence} + \Val{Bureaucracy}} to
introduce a fact~\parencite*[p.~237]{ex3} about a bureaucratic or mercantile
organization that she belongs to or is familiar with.}


\Charm{Benevolent Master's Blessing}{%
    Cost=1m,
    Duration=Indefinite,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Bureaucracy 3, Essence 2},
    Type=Simple,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~181]{db}
}{benevolent-masters-blessing}

The Dragon-Blood marks a subordinate with a sign of her authority, often
handing out a badge or token, or leaving a swirling black tattoo of Water
Essence on his hand. \tldr{If the subordinate presents the token or mark, all
who see it know instinctively that he's the Dragon-Blood's servant} (or, if
they don't know of her, the servant of a Prince of the Earth), and that he
carries authority to negotiate on her behalf. \tldr{In addition, that character
gains a temporary Bureaucracy specialty that applies on rolls to follow the
Dragon-Blood's orders or pursue her best interests.}


\Charm{Dashing Brook Method}{%
    Cost=2m 1wp,
    Duration=One task,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:benevolent-masters-blessing},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~182]{db}
}{dashing-brook-method}

The Dragon-Blood clears the obstacles that impede the flow of her bureaucracy,
channeling its labor into efficacious speed. \tldr{This Charm enhances a
project~\parencite*[p.~226]{ex3} or other bureaucratic task, multiplying the
speed at which the organization makes progress by \Pool{\Val{highest of
Charisma, Manipulation, or Intelligence}}.} The Attribute she uses must match
her leadership style. This Charm cannot speed a bureaucratic task that would
normally take more than \Pool{\Val{Essence}} years.



\CharmSection{investigation-charms}{Investigation Charms}

\Charm{Permeating Insight}{%
    Cost=4m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Investigation 3, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~198]{db}
}{permeating-insight}

Deceit, lies, and obfuscation won't avail fugitives from the Dragon-Blood's
justice. Their sins are as pellucid as crystal in her eyes. \tldr{She adds
\Pool{\Val{Essence}} non-Charm dice on a roll to profile a
character~\parencite*[p.~225]{ex3}. If she succeeds, she gains a temporary
Investigation specialty in the profiled character.} She retains the specialty
indefinitely, but may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.


\Charm{Scent-of-Crime Method}{%
    Cost=4m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Investigation 3, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:permeating-insight},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~198]{db}
}{scent-of-crime-method}

Even if a murder washes the blood from his hands, the smell of iniquity that
clings to his heart draws the magistrate to him. The Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on
an Awareness, Investigation, or Survival roll to detect the presence of a
character that has made a Larceny roll in the last \Pool{\Val{Essence}} hours.
She can determine whether or not a given individual is the source of the guilt
by successfully profiling him.


\Charm{Heart-Maze Navigation}{%
    Cost=1m 1wp,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Investigation 3, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:scent-of-crime-method},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~198]{db}
}{heart-maze-navigation}

The Dragon-Blood can test the composure of even the most practiced liar,
discovering the path that leads to the truth. \tldr{When she makes a profile
character roll, her target's Guile can be penalized by any of his Intimacies
that would support revealing information to the Dragon-Blood, lowering it as
though it were his Resolve.}

While the Dragon-Blood is in Water Aura, she can use this Charm to profile a
character instantly.


\Charm{Bloodhound's Nose Technique}{%
    Cost=4m 1wp,
    Duration={\Pool{\Val{Essence}} days},
    Keywords=Water/Wood,
    Mins={Investigation 4, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:scent-of-crime-method},
    Type=Simple,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~199]{db}
}{bloodhounds-nose-technique}

The Dragon-Blood smells the sin on a criminal's back, pursuing him through city
and wildernessalike by the scent of his iniquity. \tldr{She makes a case scene
roll with double 9's to investigate a piece of evidence. The base difficulty of
this roll is 3}, although the Storyteller may increase the difficulty based on
the length of time since the object was left, any exposure to the elements, or
supernatural concealment. \tldr{On a success, the Dragon-Blood is able to pick
up the scent of the character who left the evidence. If she's already familiar
with that individual, she identifies him immediately.}

\tldr{The Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on rolls to track that character by smell,
and can recognize his scent without needing an Awareness roll upon coming
within medium range of him.} In addition, the Storyteller may inform the player,
through the Exalt's keen sense of smell, whenever a case scene or profile
character roll would turn up information relevant to that character.



\CharmSection{melee-charms}{Melee Charms}

\Charm{Stoking Bonfire Style}{%
    Cost={1m~per~die \emph{or} 2m~per~+1~Parry},
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Excellency, Fire, Uniform},
    Mins={Melee 1, Essence 1},
    Type={Supplemental \emph{or} Reflexive},
    Reference=\cite*[p.~225]{db}
}{stoking-bonfire-style}

The Dragon-Blood's aggression stokes her Essence hotter and higher as she
strikes relentless at her opponent, until he finally falls before her mighty
onslaught. \tldr{She may add bonus dice on a Melee attack roll for one mote
each, or raise her Parry for two motes per +1. When she lands an attack against
an enemy or blocks one with this Charm, the cost of using this Charm against
him is cumulatively lowered by one mote on subsequent rounds.} Missing an
attack or failing to parry resets the discount, as does attacking or blocking
against another enemy, or going a round without using this Charm.


\Charm{Burning Fury Wreath}{%
    Cost=3m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Decisive-ony, Fire},
    Mins={Melee 2, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~225]{db}
}{burning-fury-wreath}

The Dragon-Blood's superheated edge cuts through armor as though it were ice.
\tldr{She ignores \Pool{\Val{Strength}/2}[rounded up] points of Hardness, plus
an additional point for every 10 on her attack roll.}

\tldr{In Fire Aura, double the Hardness ignored.}


\Charm{Flame-Borne Interception}{%
    Cost=4m,
    Duration=Until next turn,
    Keywords={Balanced, Fire, Uniform},
    Mins={Melee 2, Essence 1},
    Type=Reflexive,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~225]{db}
}{flame-borne-interception}

Flames wreathe the Exalt's weapon, burning brighter with each blow that it
deflects. \tldr{She gains +1 Parry until her next turn. This increases by one
each time she blocks an attack. This bonus resets if the Dragon-Blood is hit by
an attack, or defends using an Ability other than Melee.}


\Charm{Blinding Spark Distraction}{%
    Cost=1m 1i,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Fire, Uniform, Perilous},
    Mins={Melee 3, Essence 1},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:flame-borne-interception},
    Type=Reflexive,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~225]{db}
}{blinding-spark-distraction}

Sparks fly from the Dragon-Blood's weapon as it wards off an attack, blinding
her foes. \tldr{Successfully blocking an attack or winning a clash from close
range blinds her attacher~\parencite*[p.~168]{ex3} until the end of his next
turn unless he succeeds on a \Pool{\Val{Stamina} + \Val{Resistance}} roll at a
difficulty of \Pool{\Val{her Essence} + \Val{the successes he missed by}}.}


\Charm{Crimson Fang Bite}{%
    Cost=3m 1wp,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Dual, Fire},
    Mins={Melee 3, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:burning-fury-wreath},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~225]{db}
}{crimson-fang-bite}

The Dragon-Blood channels the fury of the flame to strike a devastating blow.
\tldr{She adds \Pool{\Val{higher of Essence or Strengh}} to the raw damage of
a \textit{withering} attack, or doubles \Pool{\Val{Strength}} 10s on a
\textit{decisive} damage roll.}



\CharmSection{presence-charms}{Presence Charms}

\Charm{Unbearable Taunt Technique}{%
    Cost=2m,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords=Fire,
    Mins={Presence 2, Essence 1},
    Type=Simple,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~242]{db}
}{unbearable-taunt-technique}

Even the meekest hearts are tinderboxes for the flames of outrage the
Dragon-Blood stirs. \tldr{She rolls to inspire a single character with anger.
If successful, her target must immediately respond to her with hostility.} His
player chooses the form this takes --- outrage, threats, or even Joining
Battle.

\tldr{In combat, this influence roll instead provokes an enemy into
prioritizing attacking the Dragon-Blood instead of any of her allies on his
next turn.} Even if he does pay the Willpower to resist, he loses two
Initiative if he attacks any other character that turn.


\Charm{Moth to the Candle}{%
    Cost=2m 1wp,
    Duration=One scene,
    Keywords=Fire,
    Mins={Presence 4, Essence 2},
    Prerequisites=\nameref{charm:unbearable-taunt-technique},
    Type=Simple,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~243]{db}
}{moth-to-the-candle}

Outraged foes rush headlong for the Dragon-Blood like moths plunging to their
doom. \tldr{The Dragon-Blood's enemies are so enraged by the sight of her that
they must prioritize attacking her over any other character.} This doesn't
prevent them from taking non-attack actions, but they cannot attack her allies
as long as she remains in the fight. \tldr{An enemy can resist this for one
scene by spending a point of Willpower.}

\tldr{This Charm also reduces the cost of
\nameref{charm:unbearable-taunt-technique} to one mote. If the Dragon-Blood
successfully taunts an enemy who hasn't resisted Moth to the Flame, that
character must use his next turn to move into range and attack her if
possible.}



\CharmSection{ride-charms}{Ride Charms}

\Charm{Scattered Pearl Hoof Falls}{
    Cost=2m per success,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Excellency, Wood},
    Mins={Ride 1, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~251]{db}
}{scattered-pearl-hoof-falls}

The hoofbeats of the Dragon-Blood's mount strike the ground as swiftly and
lightly as pearls falling from a broken necklace, speeding her onwards to her
goal. \tldr{She may add automatic successes to a Ride roll for two motes each,
and she ignores one point of mobility penalty from her mount's barding.}



\CharmSection{sail-charms}{Sail Charms}

\Charm{Fine Passage-Negotiating Style}{
    Cost=2m per success,
    Duration=Instant,
    Keywords={Balanced, Excellency, Water},
    Mins={Sail 1, Essence 1},
    Type=Supplemental,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~257]{db}
}{fine-passage-negotiating-style}

The Dragon-Blood threads her ship like a needle through dangerous patches of
sargasso seas, rock-strewn shallows, or warship-patrolled waters. \tldr{She may
add automatic successes to a Sail roll for two motes each, and rerolls 6s until
they cease to appear.}


\Charm{Dragon Mariner Attitude}{%
    Cost=5m,
    Duration=One scene,
    Keywords=Water,
    Mins={Sail 2, Essence 1},
    Type=Reflexive,
    Reference=\cite*[p.~257]{db}
}{dragon-mariner-attitude}

The Dragon-Blood's reputation precedes her ship to shore. She can manipulate
the flow of her reputation as though it were a stream of water, choosing one
of the following effects.

\subsubsection{Carousing}
Adopting the poise of a sailor in port, the Dragon-Blood radiates a desire to
take part in drinking, gambling, and similar vices common to sailors, as well
as any local indulgences. Characters seeking to supply such vices will seek her
out to provide them or information about where to get them.

\subsubsection{Heroism}
The Dragon-Blood's naval prowess marks her as a hero of the seas. Characters
facing problems that a seafaring hero could solve, such as pirate raids, a
loved one lost on a missing ship, or an urgent shipment of exotic goods that
needs to be delivered, will seek her out as the solution to their problem,
treating this as a Minor Tie of trust to her.

\subsubsection{Leadership}
The Dragon-Blood radiates the confidence of a commanding admiral. All sailors
under her command are treated as having a Minor Tie of respect towards her, and
she adds one bonus success on inspire rolls and command actions targeting them.
Trivial characters who are seafarers gain this Intimacy even if they aren't
part of the Exalt's crew.

\subsubsection{Menacing}
The Dragon-Blood's bearing suggests ruthlessness and a history of violence. She
adds one automatic success on threaten rolls and gains the Hideous
Merit~\parencite*[p.~162]{ex3}.
